## How to Compile
Coq version: 8.15.2

Before compiling, you shall first fetch git submodules as follows:
```
git submodule init; git submodule update
```

On Windows, you need to manually provide a CONFIGURE file to specify the paths for the required dependencies. Please create an extensionless file named CONFIGURE in the directory and write the path to your Coq installation into that file. There's no need for a CONFIGURE if you're using a Linux system and coq is in bin search path.

For example, in a cygwin build environment, the CONFIGURE file is set as follows:

```
COQBIN=/cygdrive/d/Coq-8.15/bin/
SUF=   # Here, you can also set SUF=.exe
```

If your build environment is Windows PowerShell, use the following CONFIGURE settings:

```
COQBIN=D:\Coq-8.15\bin\\
SUF=.exe
```

Before compiling, please first check whether your environment has make installed by running:

```
make --version
```

If not, you can use mingw32-make or mingw64-make as an alternative (make sure that they are installed):

```
mingw32-make --version
or
mingw64-make --version
```

Then, you can start compiling by running:

```
make
```
